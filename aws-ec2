📌 What is AWS?
AWS (Amazon Web Services) is a cloud platform that allows you to deploy applications on remote servers instead of running them on your local laptop.

Laptop → Not running 24/7

Server (Cloud) → Runs 24/7

Pay as you go pricing model

You pay only for what you use (server rent)

☁️ Cloud Service Models
1️⃣ IaaS – Infrastructure as a Service
You manage everything.

Examples:

EC2

VPC

EBS

S3 (backup)

Features:

Full control

You decide OS, software, network

Responsibility on user

2️⃣ PaaS – Platform as a Service
You focus only on application.

Features:

Cloud provider manages OS & infrastructure

Less control

Faster development

3️⃣ SaaS – Software as a Service
Ready-made software.

Examples:

Gmail

Google Drive

Features:

Just buy & use

No installation

No control

🌍 AWS Regions & Availability Zones
Region → Geographical location (Mumbai, US, London)

Availability Zone (AZ) → Multiple data centers inside a region

📌 If users are in India, choose Mumbai region for:

Low latency

High availability

Disaster recovery

⚙️ Virtualization Concept
One physical server can create multiple Virtual Machines (VMs)

Done using Hypervisor

Efficient resource usage

Cost effective

AWS idea started in 2006

🖥️ EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
EC2 = Virtual Server in AWS

EC2 Launch Steps
Name & Tags

Select AMI (Amazon Machine Image)

OS template (Linux / Windows)

Choose Instance Type

Create Key Pair

Configure Network & Security Group

Allocate Storage

Launch Instance

📀 AMI (Amazon Machine Image)
Template used to create EC2

Contains:

OS

Preinstalled software

Configuration

💻 Instance Types
Type	CPU : Memory
General Purpose	Balanced
Compute Optimized	2:1
Memory Optimized	1:2
Storage Optimized	Disk heavy
Accelerated Computing	GPU
HPC Optimized	High performance

🔐 Key Pair Authentication
Works like lock & key

Required to connect EC2 securely

Linux

.pem file

SSH

Windows

RDP

Administrator user

🌐 Networking
Total ports: 65536

Range: 0 – 65535

Common Ports

SSH → 22

RDP → 3389

HTTP → 80

HTTPS → 443

📌 Security Group Source:

pgsql
Copy code
0.0.0.0/0  → Open to all (not recommended for prod)
📊 EC2 Status Checks
✅ 2/2 Status Check
System Status Check (AWS infrastructure)

Instance Status Check (Your OS & instance)

❌ Possible States
1/2 → Partial failure

0/2 → Both failed

2/2 → Instance healthy

🛠️ System Status Check (AWS Side)
Checks:

Physical server

Network connectivity

Power

AWS storage

🖥️ Instance Status Check (User Side)
Checks:

OS boot success

CPU / Memory issues

Network configuration

🌐 Hosting Website on EC2
Website Types
Static Website (HTML, CSS, JS)

Dynamic Website

🧑‍💻 Web Server Setup
Linux
Apache → httpd

bash
Copy code
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
Windows
IIS (Internet Information Services)

📁 Website Files Location
bash
Copy code
/var/www/html
📂 File Transfer
Windows → Linux
WinSCP

Drag & Drop / Copy Paste

Copy Website Files
bash
Copy code
cp -r /home/ec2-user/* /var/www/html/
🔗 Access Website
cpp
Copy code
http://<EC2-Public-IP>
💡 Important Notes
If EC2 is stopped → website not accessible

If instance is deleted → website gone

Always keep backup (S3)
